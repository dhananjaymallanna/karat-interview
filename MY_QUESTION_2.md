Programming question:
1. Given list of string with domains and clicks
return ordered list with domains with most click. domain needs to be parsed into subdomains if any so if it's mail.yahoo.com then register them into mail.yahoo.com then yahoo.com and then .com as 3 seperate domains and return aggregrated numbers.
I did take some time on programming quesiton and finished it just before 10 mins remaining and interviewer did not give any follow up question due to time and ended early. Should i redo the test or should be okay?
